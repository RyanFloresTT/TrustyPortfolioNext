#### Introduction

I've always thought about contributing to a project for the first time, but it can be pretty daunting—especially when I hear people say, "Contribute to tools you use." I’d check out .NET's GitHub page, but even the `good first issue`s often seemed overwhelming.

A friend then introduced me to a website called [up-for-grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/), which lets you filter open-source projects by tags. After filtering for C#/.NET, I stumbled upon a really interesting tool called **AICommitMessage**. The tool generates commit messages using AI, taking your git diff and returning a relevant message. When I found an issue to integrate support for the **Llama-3-1-405B-Instruct** model, I decided to give it a shot and asked to be assigned to the task.

What followed was actually pretty fun and a rewarding experience. Not only did I complete the issue, but I also learned more about testing, environment management, and the open-source contribution process. This is a tool I’ll be using going forward, and I’m excited to contribute more to it—and to other projects as well!

Here’s a breakdown of the problems I encountered, the solutions I implemented, and what I learned along the way.

#### The Task

The issue had clearly defined goals:

1. Install the **Azure AI inference SDK**.
2. Add support for the **Llama-3-1-405B-Instruct** model.
3. Ensure both Llama and OpenAI models worked together without issues.
4. Update the documentation to include configuration steps for Llama.
5. Create meaningful unit and integration tests for the new functionality.

However, as I started working, I encountered a bit of problems like:

1. **Environment Variable Conflicts**: Managing environment variables for multiple models caused unexpected results during testing.
2. **Unpredictable AI Outputs**: Testing AI-generated outputs was difficult because responses were inherently dynamic.
3. **Unsupported Model Handling**: Gracefully handling unsupported models required clear communication without disrupting the user experience.
4. **Lack of Experience**: As my first contribution, understanding the existing project patterns added a learning curve.

#### Improved Tests for AI Outputs

AI-generated outputs are unpredictable, which makes exact-match testing impractical. I focused on validating patterns or keywords using regular expressions, ensuring flexibility while maintaining robust test coverage.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void GenerateCommitMessage_WithLlamaModel_Should_ReturnExpectedOutput()
{
    Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("AI_MODEL", "llama-3-1-405B-Instruct");
    var options = new GenerateCommitMessageOptions
    {
        Branch = "feature/llama",
        Diff = "Add llama-specific functionality",
        Message = "Initial llama commit"
    };

    var result = _service.GenerateCommitMessage(options);

    result.Should().MatchRegex("(?i)(?=.*add)(?=.*llama)");
}
```

---

#### New Problem: Defaulting Environment Variables

Another challenge was ensuring the tool behaved predictably when some environment variables were missing or set incorrectly. To handle this:

- I implemented logic to fallback to default values or existing configurations if new inputs weren’t provided.
- This ensures the tool remains usable even with incomplete configurations, reducing setup friction for developers.

```csharp
public static void SetEnvironmentVariableIfProvided(
    string variableName,
    string newValue,
    string existingValue
)
{
    var currentValue = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(variableName);

    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(newValue))
    {
        Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(variableName, newValue);
    }
    else if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(existingValue) && existingValue != currentValue)
    {
        Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(variableName, existingValue);
    }
}
```

This approach meant that users could swap between models without having to redefine keys and url endpoints.

#### Documentation Updates

Clear documentation was essential for ensuring other developers could easily configure and use the Llama model. I added:

- Instructions for configuring environment variables for both models.
- Examples of test cases for supported and unsupported models.

---

#### Results

The final implementation achieved:

1. **Seamless Integration**: Both Llama and OpenAI models worked together without disrupting existing functionality.
2. **Robust Testing**: By focusing on patterns and behaviors, tests became more reliable and flexible.
3. **Clear Documentation**: Updated documentation provided a strong roadmap for future contributors.

#### Reflection

Contributing to open-source for the first time was actually pretty fun and rewarding. I had always found the idea daunting, but this experience changed my perspective. Sure it was a smaller project, but working on AICommitMessage gave me the opportunity to learn about testing strategies, environment variable management, and the collaborative development space in general. It's a start and my intro to Open Source contributions.

I feel like this will be a tool I’ll be using regularly, and I’m excited to contribute more—both to this project and others. You can check out the project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/guibranco/dotnet-aicommitmessage), and my pull request [here](https://github.com/guibranco/dotnet-aicommitmessage/pull/155). The process has boosted my confidence, and I’m looking forward to tackling even bigger challenges in the future!
