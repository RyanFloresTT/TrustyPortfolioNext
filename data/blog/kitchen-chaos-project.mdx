This game project was developed by following a tutorial from the popular YouTube channel "Code Monkey". The creator of the channel, Code Monkey, is a well-respected and knowledgeable instructor in the Unity game development community, known for his comprehensive and informative tutorials on the platform. This project provided the opportunity to learn about Unity Events, as well as deepen understanding of C# concepts like interfaces and Unity-specific Scriptable Objects and creating good, clean code.

I decided to include this tutorial-followed project on my portfolio because it showcases the valuable skills and knowledge I gained from the experience. Although I did not build the project from scratch, completing it was a challenging and educational experience that allowed me to further understand and apply concepts such as Unity Events, C# interfaces, and Unity Scriptable Objects. By including this project, I demonstrate my dedication to learning and my ability to follow along and apply what I have learned from a credible source.

Events are AMAZING, truly. I cannot stress that enough! At some point I will have to dedicate an entire blog post to events and scriptable objects. The more I learn about these 2 concepts, the more I realize just how AWESOME they are!

I also gained a little big of familiarity with Post-Processing, URP and the New Input System. The New Input System is also VERY cool, it is something that makes it easier to build good clean code, just like scriptable objects and events. I can't wait to use what I've learned from this course in future projects where I can use these tools to leverage even more POWER!
