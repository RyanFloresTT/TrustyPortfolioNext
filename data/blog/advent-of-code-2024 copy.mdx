# Project Shmup Revival

About a month ago, I decided to resurrect Project Shmup. Despite some friends suggesting it might be too ambitious, I remain convinced this is a project worth seeing through to completion. This post covers the significant progress made since returning to development.

## Major Updates

### Core Systems & Architecture
- Implemented a new **ClassData ScriptableObject** system
  - Replaced the old Resources-folder based approach
  - Enables class progression mechanics
  - Provides support for icons and descriptions
  - Handles base stats for all entities
- In the process of developing a custom **Class Creation Tool**
  - Built using Odin and Unity Editor functionality
  - Provides an intuitive layout for spell/ability editing
  - Streamlines the class development workflow
  - Some really cool features I'd like to add are
    - Model Preview
    - Prefab Creation
    - Audio Preview
    - Basically, everything that *can* deal with classes, I want in this tool.

### Gameplay Improvements
- Enhanced animation system
  - Added movement animations
  - Implemented a death sequence for the player
  - Added support for ability animations and SFX
    - Used Ability Types to add different SFX/Animations based on type. Ex. Projectile Abilities need an explosion sfx and animation.
  - Utilizing animation layers for better control
- Refined player and enemy systems
  - Cleaned up Playable Classes codebase
  - Improved entity initialization through ClassData
    - Classes like the Pyromancer are based on ClassData and BaseStats. BaseStats is a field of ClassData.
    - This leads to better tuning knobs
  - Fixed NavMesh pathing issues

### Audio & Visual Updates
- Implemented new sound system features
  - Added AudioManagers
  - Integrated title screen music
  - Created ability-specific SFX framework
    - Generic "Cast" sounds
    - Special "Explosion" effects for projectiles
- Visual improvements
  - Updated ability VFX
  - Shifted to a 3rd person, over the shoulder, camera angle
  - Imported new art assets for level design

### UI and Game Flow
- Started development on Class Selection UI
  - Mostly works, might need a few tweaks to visuals and code cleanup
- Implemented game flow sequence
  - Title Scene → Logo → Class Selection → Default Level
  - Added seamless death-to-class-selection loop
    - I had problems doing this at first, had a lot of reference issues, but managed to fix them all for the infinite gameplay loop

## Technical Deep Dives

[Upcoming Blogs]
- Comparison of AI NavMesh vs A* pathfinding
- Analysis of built-in Unity UI vs UI Toolkit
- Detailed look at the Class Creation Tool
- Discussion of tool selection criteria
- Add spawn and death sequence for the enemies

## Next Sprint Goals

- Fix bug where enemies won't die past wave 1
- Rotate toward the cursor when the player when an ability is used that needs to be aimed (Projectile)
- Tighten up SFX/Animations
- Balance Leveling Curve for Players and Spawn Rate Curve for Enemies
  - Hopefully leading to a more balanced game to play and give to friends to playtest the simple gameplay loop I have
- Implement a scoring system
  - Score will be based on how many waves you can successfully clear
- Give Enemies a Spawn/Death animation
- Use NavMesh to spawn enemies around the player, so I don't have to use hard-coded positions

## Future Plans

### These are stretch goals that I want to acheive in the future

- Upgrade System
- Class Unlock System
- Permanent Upgrades to Classes
- Equipment/Loot/Whatever In-Game/Runs
- 1 Boss Fight
  - Boss Music + Phases
  - Boss Specific Loot/Upgrades
  - Boss Specific Environments
- Multiple Levels

I know this is a long list of things to read, but my future standups will be more concise. This extended format was chosen to provide a comprehensive catch-up on the project's current state.

I'm very excited to be working on this game and see where it goes. If you have any comments or suggestions, I'm open to feedback in the comments!
