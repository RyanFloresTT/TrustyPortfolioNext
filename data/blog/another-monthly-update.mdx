Hello and welcome to another monthly update! I've been working on a few things, and I'm excited to share them with you. This month, I'm diving into a new project: the Book Collection App. It's been a pretty fun experience, and I can't wait to show you the progress I've made.

Despite my ongoing passion for game development, I find myself continually drawn back into web app projects. It's partly because I believe it enhances my job prospects, but I also recognize that it's my own decision to prioritize these projects. I often tell myself I'll return to making games, but the allure a better job opportunity keeps pulling me back.

Lately, I've been feeling a bit down with all the talk about AI potentially replacing developers. It's a daunting thought, but I've decided to push those fears aside. It might seem naive, but I believe in my capabilities and am determined to secure a job. I know the industry is changing, it's in a tough spot, but I know I'm capable, I just have to wait for the right opportunity to come along.

Once I wrap up the Book Collection App, and help a friend with his website, I'm going to finally create a card game. I'm also planning to focus heavily on tooling, even developing an external tool to assist in creating cards for my game. It's an exciting time, and I'm excited to see what comes of these projects.
