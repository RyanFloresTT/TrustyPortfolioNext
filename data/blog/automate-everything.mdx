summary: I automated my website deployment on my Ubuntu server from DigitalOcean.
---

I have recently been making a lot of smaller changes to my website, which means I have to go to my droplet on DigitalOcean and update it through several commands. I am using pm2, a process manager that is supposed to listen in on my file changes and update them as I go, but it’s mainly for node.js programs and since I’m using .NET, I think there might be some compatibility issues and it doesn’t do that for my project. I still use it so my Ubuntu server is ready to go and handle other tasks if I ever need to get on there and do something while my website is still running.

The process isn’t necessarily hard or very time consuming, but it is quite tedious when I start to do it once a day after I push my changes to the repo. I recently took a course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), which taught me a little more about Ubuntu, and bash commands and scripts. I decided to pursue some automation in my website using some of what I learned.

It isn’t much, but it is most definitely going to save me time and increase my overall efficiency with publishing changes to my website.

Here’s the script I made:

```bash
**#!/bin/bash

cd TrustyPortfolio

git fetch
git pull

cd ..

# Manage pm2 processes
pm2 delete 0
pm2 save --force
pm2 start dotnet --name `TrustyPortfolio` -- run --project `TrustyPortfolio/TrustyPortfolio.csproj`
pm2 save

# Run certbot with the required inputs
certbot&lt;&lt;EOF
1 2
1
EOF**
```

I use SSH for my git on this Ubuntu droplet, so I need to input my password for each command, and I was trying to experiment with having the script automatically input my password for me, but I wasn’t able to figure it out. So right now, I still have to manually input my password twice each time I run this script, but it’s still a lot better than manually writing all of the rest of what I need to do to re-run my website with the new changes.

After this little bit of automation, I’d like to explore more ways I can automate the boring stuff(a book I still need to read btw). As of now I’m not sure what will come up, but knowing that I *can* automate, means I can identify potential pain points in my workflows that would benefit from automation.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day!
