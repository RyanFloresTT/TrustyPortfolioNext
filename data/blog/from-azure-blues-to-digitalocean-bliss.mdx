summary: Azure is expensive! DigitalOcean is not!

Today we’re going to talk about a perfect example that illustrates the classic trade-off between managed services and DIY solutions.

I'm a developer who made my portfolio from scratch and was looking for a place to host my website, and like many, I initially opted for the convenience of a managed cloud platform. Azure seemed like a perfect fit because of it’s integration with Visual Studio (my current choice of idE), but after just five days, the bill came as a shock – it was almost 6x what I expected! This sparked a quest for a more cost-effective solution. I have a friend who is currently a Web Developer and he told me about DigitalOcean, so I decided to explore it as an option.

Azure's managed services offered ease of use, but the cost quickly became unsustainable for my project. DigitalOcean offered a more budget-friendly option, but it required a hands-on approach.

Here's a brief overview of what I did to get my website on DigitalOcean:

- **Droplet and Database Creation:** I went on DigitalOcean, created an account and created a Droplet, a virtual machine which runs Ubuntu. I also opted to buy an instanced Database which I can split as necessary, which I did to include the 2 databases I needed for my portfolio.
- **Virtual Ubuntu Machine:** I set up a virtual Ubuntu machine on DigitalOcean, giving me full control over the server environment.
- **.NET Installation:** I had to manually install the .NET runtime so that I can actually run my project.
- **Git File Management:** I set up my repo inside the virtual machine so that I can pull my changes from my local computer to it so I can update it whenever I want with ease.
- **Project Deployment:** I deployed my project directly onto the virtual machine.
- **Process Management:** I used pm2, a process manager, to keep my application running smoothly.
- **SSL Certificate:** To secure my website, I obtained an SSL certificate using Certbot.

**Results & Impact:**

The initial setup on DigitalOcean was definitely more involved than Azure's managed approach. However, the cost savings were immediate – I cut my hosting bill by a factor of 6! More importantly, this hands-on experience gave me a valuable understanding of the underlying infrastructure powering my game.

**Conclusion:**

Moving from Azure to DigitalOcean wasn't without its challenges, I had to figure out how to change the connection string DigitalOcean gave me to be in the appropriate format for my application, but overall I’d say the process went _very_ smooth and I’d recommend it to anyone who is looking to host their non-static site somewhere! The cost savings and newfound knowledge were well worth it. As it stands right now, I’m paying about \$20 a month for this portfolio to be hosted, but that includes the $15/mo Instanced Database. I opted to use this because I can partition it as many times as I want for future projects that I want to test out that might need a database.

Digital Ocean also offers a \$200 credit for new users, so I’m not even paying anything out of pocket for the next 10 months! They have a referral program so if you want to use my referral and get your $200 credit, click the badge below!
