# BookCollection

Welcome to **BookCollection**! This is a personal project that showcases my skills in full-stack development, integrating various technologies to create a seamless and efficient application.

## Overview

BookCollection is a web application designed to help users manage their personal book collections. The application features a robust backend built with Go, a dynamic frontend developed with React, and is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and environment management.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication is handled by a single endpoint in the Go backend, which redirects to the third-party service Auth0 for a streamlined and secure login experience.
- **Book Management**: Users can add, view, and manage their book collections with ease.
- **Modern Frontend**: A responsive and interactive user interface built with React.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to compose the backend and frontend services together, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: Backend API and authentication endpoint.
- **Auth0**: Third-party service for secure user authentication.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for managing and deploying the application.
