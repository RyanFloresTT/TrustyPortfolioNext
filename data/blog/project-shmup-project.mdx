This project is currently still in development, this post will most likely change overtime.

This project’s source code is not available yet, but it might be after we release it on steam. This won’t stop me from sharing code for a better visual on what I’m working on. If you’re looking for the next best thing to source code, below I talk about external documentation we’ve set up, you can view it [[here]](https://www.notion.so/Shmup-Code-Documentation-a472ac554476456baabfe83d99637f99?pvs=21).

My friend Robby and I are using Unity to create this game. Inspired by games like Diablo, Vampire Survivors, Risk of Rain and other Rogue-likes and Rogue-lites, our game will feature boss fights, classes, abilities and powers to obtain to make you fulfil your power fantasy and **DESTROY EVERYTHING**.

It’s been really fun working with Robby on this project. After building the project for a month or so, I decided to use some free assets so we’re not just staring at our amazing programmer art the entire time. Here’s a video on how the game plays right now.

Once we reach an MVP, we think we’ll try and reach out to other people to see if they want to help and collaborate on this project with us. We’d need a 3D artist, Sound Designer/ Composer, and a Game Designer.

Our next objectives before we think we’ll have an MVP is to include some sort of boss fight, and some sort of upgrade system. I’m still not sure how I want the upgrade system to be, but I’m also quite sure that once we get a Game Designer in here, they might want to change it up to their liking.

I just finished creating a document to onboard newcomers, it was my first time at writing external documentation. If you’d like to view it, it’s [here](https://www.notion.so/Shmup-Code-Documentation-a472ac554476456baabfe83d99637f99?pvs=21). So far, it goes over each of the systems in our game that I’ve created, and will be continually updated.

Thanks for reading, I’ll make sure to update this and create some more blog posts on the project. It’s really starting to come together and I’ve really enjoyed working on it so far.
