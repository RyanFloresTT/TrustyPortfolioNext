summary: I use C# Records and JSON in my discord bot.

Hello and welcome to another blog post! Today I am going over how and why I made use of Records and the JSON file type in my Discord Bot.

**Context:**
I am building a set of commands where the user can either:
• Input a Game's name into the list, along with a description if they choose to
• Remove a Game from the list by it's name only
• Output a random game name from the list available
• See the list of games at any point
I made each command in this order so I began with putting a game name into the list.

**Problem:**
While I have experience with JSON in other forms of programming, I have never used it while programming in C#. I actually began this problem using a plain text file which was most definitely the wrong choice. I actually did just lie a little there by saying I have never used JSON in C#, because in my last post about creating the `JokeCommand`, I made use of a JSON formatted data received from an API in the form of an HTTP request. I made use of this knowledge that I can serialize objects from a JSON format into a class and decided that this would be the best option for me going forward.

**Solution:**
I ended up trying to copy my solution to the `JokeCommand` problem and try and replicate it for this one. I knew I needed to create a new class where I could store the data for the Games so I made use of Records here to make `GameData`.

This is what my record looks like :

```csharp
public record GameData(string Name, string Description);
```

Records are an amazing way to build classes that are meant to hold data! They are super simple to declare as you can see too which is amazing.
I then created a static class called `GameDataFileUtils` so that I can call methods from this class anywhere to change my GameData from the JSON file. I'll go over each method here and explain what it does.

```csharp
public static void Write(object obj, string filePath) {
var jsonString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, Formatting.Indented, options);
File.WriteAllText(filePath, jsonString);
}

```

This is my `Write` method. Pretty simple, but it takes an object and a file path and writes it to that file in the form of JSON with indentation turned on.

```csharp
public static void Add(GameData data, string fileName) {
var contents = ReadFromJSON(fileName);
contents.Add(data);
Write(contents, fileName);
}
```


This is the `Add` method. This takes in a GameData and a filepath. I will explain what `ReadFromJSON` does in just a second, but that method returns a list of GameData, reading from the file. I have to do this because when I write to the file, I am rewriting the entire file, so if I were to write a single entry in a file that has many more, it will wipe it out and leave only the single entry. I cache the contents of the file, add the new GameData and then write it back to the file.

```csharp
public static void Remove(string gameName, string fileName) {
var contents = ReadFromJSON(fileName);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; contents.Count; i++) {
if (contents[i].Name == gameName) {
contents.Remove(contents[i]);
break;
}
}
Write(contents, fileName);
}
```


This `Remove` method searches through the file linearly (which I could optimize), and removes the first element of the JSON file which matches the string input from the user.

```csharp
public static List&lt;GameData&gt; ReadFromJSON(string filePath) {
using StreamReader reader = new(filePath);
var json = reader.ReadToEnd();
List&lt;GameData&gt; data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;GameData&gt;&gt;(json);
return data;
}
```


This `ReadFromJSON` method reads the JSON file, and converts it's contents into a list of `<GameData>` by use of the `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<GameData>>(json)` line.

This works for now, but I know that I will run into a problem with this `GameFileUtils` class if I ever want to manipulate a JSON file that would be of a data type other than `GameData`. For now this is my solution, but I will work on another one in the meantime. Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day!
