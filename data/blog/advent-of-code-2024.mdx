## Hello and Welcome

I haven't made many commits in the past week or so, but that doesn't mean I haven't been coding! I've been working on a few projects as well as doing some of last years Advent of Code! I had never heard about it before this year, and I'm really excited to be trying it out this year. It's a really fun take on problem solving. There's a whole storyline with it which makes it a little nicer than doing your typical LeetCode problems.

As I was doing the first couple of days, I quickly realized that I was doing the same thing over again.

- Opening a file
- Reading each line
- Operating on the line and getting some data from it
- Totaling the results from each line

Since this was happening each day, I decided to create a class that would help me get things going faster. Little did I know that not all days would need me to parse each line, but it was still frequent enough that it was still worth it to make.

Here is the class and I'll go over my thoughts on it.

```cs
public static class LineUtils
{
	public static async Task ProcessFileLinesAsync<T>(string directoryName, string filename, Func<string?, Task<T>> processLine, Func<T, Task> handleResult)
	{
	    try
	    {
	        using StreamReader sr = new($"{GetWorkingDirectory()}{directoryName}/{filename}");
	        var line = await sr.ReadLineAsync();

	        while (line != null)
	        {
		        var res = await processLine(line);
	            await handleResult(res);
	            line = await sr.ReadLineAsync();
	        }
	    }
	    catch (Exception e)
	    {
		    Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + e.Message);
		}
	}
}
```

So I had originally had this as a non-generic function which just returned an integer, but I changed it when I realized I needed to return different values. This opens up a a file based on the filename. I also created a different helper class that would get my current working directory. I switch between my laptop and desktop frequently enough that it was getting annoying changing my paths to the project.

After the filename parameter, I have a `processLine` func which takes in a string and returns T. This is the method that we will be using to parse each line with. For example, on Day1, I had to do something like this for PartOne.

```cs
static Task<int> PartOneHelper(string? line)
{
    var lineSum = 0;

    // Find the first numeric character from the left
    for (var i = 0; i < line.Length; i++)
    {        if (!char.IsDigit(line[i])) continue;
        lineSum += int.Parse(line[i].ToString()) * 10;
        break;
    }
    // Find the first numeric character from the right
    for (var i = line.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
	    if (!char.IsDigit(line[i])) continue;
        lineSum += int.Parse(line[i].ToString());
        break;
    }
}
```

Then, all I have to do is

```cs
public static async Task<int> PartOne(string filename = "input.txt")
{
    var sum = 0;

    await LineUtils.ProcessFileLinesAsync("Day1", filename, PartOneHelper, result => sum += result));

	return sum;
}
```

I use a default parameter here because I also run Unit Tests using NUnit which specify a different file, usually `example.txt`.

The last part of the function is the `handleResult` func. This usually ends up being an anonymous function like you see above

```cs
result => sum += result
```

So after each parse, it will return what came of `PartOneHelper` and add it to the sum, which when we finish with parsing all lines, returns the entire sum.

This was very helpful because it took away the need to think about opening a file and what not, and allowed me to focus on the problem at hand, what I needed to do to each line and what the end result would look like.

I'm going to be _hopefully_ using this during this year's Advent of Code, as long as they don't change up the format and we'd still be reading lines and returning values.

I really loved the challenge and puzzle solving that this event gives, I'm excited to hop into it this year. Will you be participating?
