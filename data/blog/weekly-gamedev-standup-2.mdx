# **Dev Blog: Enemy Animations, Wave Scoring, and Scene Management**

Hey everyone! Itâ€™s been a sorta productive week, I wish I had a bit more time to work on things, I feel like I didn't get much done but let's dive right in! With a mix of bug fixes, new features, and some quality-of-life improvements, hereâ€™s a breakdown of what Iâ€™ve been working on and whatâ€™s coming next.

---

## **Whatâ€™s New?**

### **1. Enemy Death & Spawn Animations**
- **Added a death animation to enemies** â€“ No more just disappearing into the void! Enemies now play an animation before despawning.
- **Started working on spawn animations** â€“ For now, itâ€™s just the death animation played in reverse (hey, it works! ðŸ˜†). Iâ€™ll polish this later with something more fitting. These aren't in the gameplay footage for this week, but it was something that I worked on.

### **2. Fixed the "No Death Past Wave 2" Bug**
This was an interesting one. After refactoring the `Health` class, I added a check to prevent replaying death animations and firing off events if the character was already dead. However, I forgot to **reset the health** when pulling enemies back from the object pool. And since the game thought they were already dead, I couldn't kill enemies.
### **3. Wave-Based Scoring System (Temporary)**
- **Implemented a basic wave-scoring system** â€“ The longer you survive, the higher your score.
- **Max score now displays on the title screen** â€“ Flex those high scores!

### **4. Scene Management & Replayability**
- **Stitched together scenes for smoother progression** â€“ You can now transition between four different levels. These are pre-made levels that came with the Synty packs I'm using.
- **Bug Alert:** Thereâ€™s an issue where the game sometimes skips the next level before continuing. Still investigating! I think it has to do with the way I'm incrementing wave count, and moving to the shop when I hit a certain point, I've got to look into it more.
- **Made temporary coins static** â€“ Coins now persist between scenes, so you donâ€™t lose them when changing levels. Permanent coins remain unchanged, these are saved to the file, these temporary coins will be used in the shop level in the future.

### **5. Enemy Spawning Improvements**
Instead of dropping enemies randomly on NavMesh points (which sometimes spawned them out of bounds), Iâ€™ve **restricted spawning to predefined points** near the player. A more controlled solution is in the works, sorta, still planning on what I'd like to do here. If you have any suggestions lmk!

### **6. New Shop Scene (WIP)**
- Created a blank shop scene (for now).
- It fires a `PlayerHasFinishedShopping` event after 1 secondâ€”just a placeholder until I implement actual shop mechanics.
- Something that I realize I'm doing ***very*** wrong, is enumerating over an enum, and using the next value to go to that scene. I don't like this at all, it just feels icky. I want to have a way more controlled way of handling this. A solution I'll be exploring is a ScriptableObject that holds a list of scenes I want to go to, in that order.

### **7. Experience System Refactor**
- **Replaced the public `Experience` field with a virtual `GetExperience()` method** â€“ Now, each character type (player, enemy) can define its own experience logic.
- For example, this allows me to give Players have a static experience, while enemies have an instance for each game object.

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**

### **Quality of Life Improvements**
- **Rotate player toward cursor when casting spells** â€“ Right now, players can use abilities while facing the camera, still firing projectiles in the direction of the cursor, which can lead to inaccuracies in aiming. I plan to rotate the player quickly to that new direction on firing.
- **UI polish** â€“ Cleaner menus, better feedback.
- **Enemy ability casting only in Line of Sight (LoS)** â€“ No more unfair attacks through walls.
- **Force class selection before starting the game** â€“ No more accidentally jumping in without choosing a playstyle.
- **Fix Y-axis bug for area-denial abilities** â€“ Right now, some spells like the Area Denials cast into the ground instead of at the correct height.

### **Optimizations & Future Work**
- **Update documentation** â€“ Keeping track of changes for future me (and anyone else who reads this).
- **Clean Files and Refactor where Necessary** - I need/want to clean up my code. For the most part, things are documented, and are clean, but I can do better. Like putting files into their proper namespaces and continuing to update internal docs.
- **Optimize ability registration** â€“ Reduce overhead when loading abilities.
	- Right now I have every single enemy and player (even though there is only ever 1 player) register their abilities during their early lifecycle stages. This is definitely unnecessary. I could just have a separate monobehavior that does this a single time.
	- Thinking about it, it really could be a static class that I call as soon as the game starts, something I can call on title screen load or something similar.
- **Create a scene template for new levels** â€“ Speed up level creation with a reusable base.
	- There are multiple prefabs that I have to add to a level to allow everything to work at this point, creating a template scene for me will speed up things a lot.

## **Final Thoughts**
Lots of progress, but still plenty to do! The biggest challenges right now are **scene management bugs** and **enemy spawning logic**, but Iâ€™m excited to refine these systems.

What do you think? Any features youâ€™d like to see prioritized? Let me know!

Until next time, happy coding! ðŸš€
