I'm a software engineer who enjoys backend development and above all, creating games in Unity. I have a passion for learning and often explore topics related to server technologies and infrastructure.

I'm frequently tinkering with different programming languages to build servers or scripts.

World of Warcraft and Warcraft 3 are what got me into both gaming and game development. I started playing them since I was 8 years old and I've been playing them ever since.

I enjoy exploring different worlds and creating my own stories with friends and family, and analyzing game mechanics and thinking about how I could implement them in my own games.

In my free time, I love playing video games, with current favorites like Path of Exile 2, World of Warcraft, and God of War.

When I'm not gaming or coding, I'm always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve, focusing on Unity and tooling to ensure quality games are made.
