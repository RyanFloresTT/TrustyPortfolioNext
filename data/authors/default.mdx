I'm a software engineer who enjoys backend development and creating games in both Unreal Engine and Unity. I have a passion for learning and often explores topics related to servers and backend systems.

I'm frequently tinkering around with languages like Go and Rust to build servers or scripts. In addition to game devlopment, I have a strong interest in server technologies and backend infrastructure.

In my free time, I love playing video games, with current favorites like Diablo 4, World of Warcraft, and God of War. When I'm not gaming or coding, I'm always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.
